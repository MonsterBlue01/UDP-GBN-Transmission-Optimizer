# Problem 1: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120
# Problem 2: 3 * 7 * 5 * 2 = 210
# Problem 3: 9 * 8 = 72  (Permutation of 9 distinct objects taken 2 at a time: 9!/(9-2)! = 9!/7! = 9*8)
# Problem 4: 4! + 5! = 1024
# Problem 5: C^8_3 = 8!/3!5! = 56
# Problem 6:Think as if A and B are grouped as one F, then there are 4! ways to permute F, C, D, and E. Moreover, in group F, there are 2! ways
# to permute A and B. So the answer is: 4!x2!
