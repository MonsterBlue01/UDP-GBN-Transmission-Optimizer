// Section 1.4: 6: Q: Suppose that one card is to be selected from a deck of 20 cards that contains 10 red cards numbered from 1 to 10 and 10 
//                 blue cards numbered from 1 to 10. Let A be the event that a card with an even number is selected, let B be the event that 
//                 a blue card is selected, and let C be the event that a card with a number less than 5 is selected. Describe the sample space 
//                 S and describe each of the following events both in words and as subsets of S:
//                 a. A ∩ B ∩ C 
//                 b. B ∩ C^c 
//                 c. A ∪ B ∪ C
//                 d. A ∩ (B ∪ C) 
//                 e. A^c ∩ B^c ∩ C^c

//                 A: {2b, 4b}
//                 B: {5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b}
//                 C: {1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b, 1r, 2r, 3r, 4r, 5r, 6r, 7r, 8r, 9r, 10r}
//                 D: {2b, 4b, 6b, 8b, 10b, 2r, 4r}
//                 E: {5r, 7r, 9r}


// print "Hello, World!" to the console
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
