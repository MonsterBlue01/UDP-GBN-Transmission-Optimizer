Section 1.4: 6: Q: Suppose that one card is to be selected from a deck of 20 cards that contains 10 red cards numbered from 1 to 10 and 10 
                blue cards numbered from 1 to 10. Let A be the event that a card with an even number is selected, let B be the event that 
                a blue card is selected, and let C be the event that a card with a number less than 5 is selected. Describe the sample space 
                S and describe each of the following events both in words and as subsets of S:
                a. A ∩ B ∩ C 
                b. B ∩ C^c 
                c. A ∪ B ∪ C
                d. A ∩ (B ∪ C) 
                e. A^c ∩ B^c ∩ C^c

                A: {2b, 4b}
                B: {5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b}
                C: {1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b, 1r, 2r, 3r, 4r, 5r, 6r, 7r, 8r, 9r, 10r}
                D: {2b, 4b, 6b, 8b, 10b, 2r, 4r}
                E: {5r, 7r, 9r}

            7: Suppose that a number x is to be selected from the real line S, and let A, B, andC be the events represented by the following subsets of S, where the notation {x:---} denotes the set containing every point x for which the property presented following the colon is satisfied:
            A = {x: 1 ≤ x ≤ 5},
            B = {x: 3 < x ≤ 7},
            C = {x: x ≤ 0}.
            
            Describe each of the following events as a set of real
            numbers:
            a. A^c 
            b. A ∪ B 
            c. B ∩ C^c
            d. A^c ∩ B^c ∩ C^c 
            e. (A ∪ B) ∩ C

            a. {x: x < 1 or x > 5}
            b. {x: 1 ≤ x ≤ 7}
            c. {x: 3 < x ≤ 7}
            d. {x: x > 7}
            e. Ø

            8: A: {A ∩ B^c}
            B: {A^c ∩ B}
            O: {A^c ∩ B^c}
            AB: {A ∩ B}


// print "Hello, World!" to the console
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
