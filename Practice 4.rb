Question 1: (a): 5! / ((5 - 2)! * 2!) * (0.75)^2 * (0.25)^3 = 0.087891
            (b): P(x = 4) = 0.395508
                 P(x = 5) = 0.237305
                 P((x = 4) ∨ (x = 5)) = 0.632813
                 P = 1 - 0.632813 = 0.367188

Question 2: (a): 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.6561
            (b): 
            (c): It is asssumed that their winning probability in the playoffs is just the same as that in the regular season, and that the games in the playoffs are independent from each other. 

Question 3: (a): If we take No. of combinations to dealt 7 cards from a deck of 52 cards without restriction: 52C7
               There are 12 face cards and 40 non-face cards in the deck: 12C2 × 40C5
               P = 12C2 × 40C5 / 52C7 ≈ 0.3246
            (b): P for no queen: 48C7/52C7
               P for at least one queen: 1 - 48C7/52C7

Question 4: P(10 ≤ x ≤ 13) = 18C13 - 18C9 = 0.6078

Question 5: (a): 17C5/20C5
            (b): 3C2 x 17C3 / 20C5

Question 6: (a):
            (b):

Question 7: 0.2656

Question 8: (a): P(X = 5|λ = 3) = (e^-3 * (3)^5) / 5! = 0.1008
            (b): P(X < 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = ((e^-3 * (3)^0) / 0!) + ((e^-3 * (3)^1) / 1!) + ((e^-3 * (3)^2) / 2!) = 0.4233
            (c): P(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)] = 1 - [((e^-3 * (3)^0) / 0!) + ((e^-3 * (3)^1) / 1!)] = 0.8008

Question 9(Optional): P(X = 1.2|λ = 1.5) = (e^-1.5 * (1.5)^1.2) / 1.2! = 0.2231
