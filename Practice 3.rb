Problem 1: (a): Probability that the convict committed armed robbery given that theconvict pushed dope.
            (b): Probability that the convict did not push dope given that the convict committed armed robbery.
            (c): Probability that the convict did not commit armed robbery given that the convict did not push dope.
Problem 2: (a): 28/78
            (b): 95/102
Problem 3: P (MM) = 0.4, P (MW) = 0.5 and P (MM|MW) = 0.7
            (a): P (MM and MW) = 0.5 * 0.7 = 0.35
            (b): P (MW|MM) = P(MM and MW) / P(MM) = 0.35 / 0.4 = 0.875
            (c): P (MM or MW) = P (MW) + P (MM) − P (MM and MW) = 0.4 + 0.5 − 0.35 = 0.55.
