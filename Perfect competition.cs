Perfect competition: 
    - Lots of buyers and sellers
    - Free access to the market
    - Information flow

Monopolistic competition:
    - Product differentiation
    - Lots of companies
    - Free entry or exit of companies (not many barriers to entry)
    - Each supplier independently decides the market strategy (not a joint monopoly)
    - Suppliers have relatively high market pricing power
    - Buyer and seller have incomplete information

Monopoly, generally refers to the sole seller in one or more markets, through one or more stages, facing competitive consumers, as opposed to a buyer's 
monopoly.
