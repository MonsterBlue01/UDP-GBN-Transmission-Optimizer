# Problem 1: Assume that x ∈ B^c. We need to show that x ∈ A^c. Let us show this indirectly. By way of contradiction we assume, that x ∈ A. Then x ∈ B because 
#            A ⊂ B. ⇒⇐ (contradiction) because we assumed that x ∈ B^c. Hence x ∈/ A implies x ∈ A^c.
# Problem 3: i. (A U B)^c = A^c ∩ B^c
#               Let P = (A U B)^c and Q = A^c ∩ B^c. Let x be an arbitrary element of P then x ∈ P ⇒ x ∈ (A U B)^c ⇒ x ∉ (A U B) ⇒ x ∉ A and x ∉ B ⇒ x ∈ A^c 
#               and x ∈ B^c ⇒ x ∈ A^c ∩ B^c ⇒ x ∈ Q. Therefore, P ⊂ Q.
#            ii.(A ∩ B)^c = A^c U B^c
#               Let P = (A U B)^c and Q = A^c ∩ B^c. Let y be an arbitrary element of Q then y ∈ Q ⇒ y ∈ A^c ∩ B^c ⇒ y ∈ A^c and y ∈ B^c ⇒ y ∉ A and y ∉ B ⇒ 
#               y ∉ (A U B) ⇒ y ∈ (A U B)^c ⇒ y ∈ P. Therefore, Q ⊂ P.
# Problem 6: a. An event in which an even blue card less than 5 is drawn.
#            b. An event in which a blue card of not less than 5 is drawn.
#            c. Draw a card less than 5 or a blue card or draw an even number of events.
#            d. The event of drawing a blue even-numbered card or drawing an even-numbered card less than 5.
#            e. An event where an odd number of red cards of not less than 5 is selected.
# Problem 7: a. {x < 1 ∪ x > 5}
#            b. {3 < x <= 5}
#            c. {x > 7}
#            d. {3 < x <= 7}
#            e. {Ø}
# Problem 8: A. A = {A}
#            B. B = {B}
#            AB. AB = {A ∪ B}  
#            O. O = {A ∩ B}
