Section 2.1: 1: Pr(A|B) = Pr(A and B)/Pr(B) = Pr(A)/Pr(B)
            2: Pr(A|B) = Pr(A and B)/Pr(B) = 0/Pr(B) = 0
            3: Pr(A|S) = Pr(A and S)/Pr(S) = Pr(A)/Pr(S) = Pr(A)/1 = Pr(A)
            4: Pr(A1 ∩ A2 ∩ B1 ∩ B2) = P(A1) * P(A2 | A1) * P(B1 | (A1 ∩ A2)) * P(B2 | (A1 ∩ A2 ∩ B1)) = 1/2 * 1/3 * 2/3 * 1/3 = 1/27
            5: Pr = (r / (r + b)) * ((r + k) / (r + b + k)) * ((r + 2k) / (r + b + 2k)) * (b / (r + b + 3k))

Section 2.2: 4: There are six way to get 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). So the probability is 6/36 = 1/6
            probability for three time: 1/6^3 = 0.00463
            7: P(A)=0.8
            P(B)=0.6
            P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.48
            
            So the probability is P(A or B) = P(A) +P(B)- P(A and B)
            = 0.8 + 0.6 - 0.48
            = 0.92
            12. (a): (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/4
            (b): ((1/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) + (3/4) * (1/3) * (1/2) + (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2)) = 11/24
