#             5. Now we can choose 4 different numbers from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by 6C4 ways. Then we can asign this to four dices in 4! ways. The number of 
#             possibilities of event A is 6C4 * 4! = 6!/4!2! * 4! = 6!/2.
#             P(A) = 6!/2 / 6^4 = 6!/2 / 1296 = 5/18
#             7. Total number of possible cases: 20^12

#             4: Probability that all four bulbs will be defective: 4C4 / 24C4 = (4!/(4!*0!) / (24!/(4!*20!)
#             6: Let's treat A and B as one person. AB can seat as (n - 1)! ways. And they have 2! ways to choose their seats. So the total number of way to 
#             choose the seats are 2!(n - 1)! / n! = 2! / n! = 2 / n
#             10: Total number of ways: 24C10 = 24! / (10! * 14!).
#             The number of ways to select two defective light bulbs with other eight normal bulbs: 2C2 * 22C8 = 319770 / 1961256 = 0.1630
#             11: The number of all ways: 100C12
#             The number of ways to choose 2 people with other people (all 10): 98C10
#             The probability: 98C10 / 100C12 = 0.0133
