Section 1.5: 3: Consider two events A and B such that Pr(A) = 1/3 and Pr(B) = 1/2. Determine the value of Pr(B ∩ A^c) for each of the following conditions:
            (a) A and B are disjoint;
            (b) A ⊂ B;
            (c) Pr(A ∩ B) = 1/8.

            (a): Pr(A) = 1/3, Pr(A^c) = 2/3. ∵A and B are disjoint. ∴Pr(B ∩ A^c) = Pr(B) = 1/2.
            (b): Pr(B ∩ A^c) = 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6.
            (c): Pr(B ∩ A^c) = 1/2 - 1/8 = 3/8.

            4: If the probability that student A will fail a certain statistics examination is 0.5, the probability that student B will fail the examination is 0.2, and the probability that both student A and 
            student B will fail the examination is 0.1, what is the probability that at least one of these two students will fail the examination?

            0.5 + 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.6

            6: For the conditions of Exercise 4, what is the probability that exactly one of the two students will fail the examination?

            (0.5 - 0.1) + (0.2 - 0.1) = 0.5

            7: Consider two events A and B with Pr(A) = 0.4 andnPr(B) = 0.7. Determine the maximum and minimum possible values of Pr(A ∩ B) and the conditions under which each of these values is attained.

            Max: When A ⊂ B,  Pr(A ∩ B) = 0.4
            Min: When A U B = 1, Pr(A ∩ B) = 0.1
            
            9: Prove that for every two events A andB, the probability that exactly one of the two events will occur is given by the expression Pr(A) + Pr(B) - 2 Pr(A ∩ B).

            Use graph to prove it.

            14: Consider, once again, the four blood types A, B, AB, and O described in Exercise 8 in Sec. 1.4 together with the two antigens anti-A and anti-B. Suppose that, for a given person, the probability of 
            type O blood is 0.5, the probability of type A blood is 0.34, and the probability of type B blood is 0.12.
            (a): Find the probability that each of the antigens will react with this person's blood.
            (b): Find the probability that both antigens will react with this person's blood.

            O: 0.5, B: 0.12, A: 0.34, AB: 0.04
            (a): A: 0.34 + 0.04 = 0.38, B: 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.16
            (b): AB: 0.04
